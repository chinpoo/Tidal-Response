# Tidal-Response
 Version 2.0, by CHUAN QIN
 
 This program is used to calculate the elastic tidal response of a planet
 with 3-D elastic and density structures in any depth ranges of the manle.
 Perturbation theory is adopted for the formulation and spectral method is
 used for solving mode couplings and tidal response. The total tidal 
 response is represented by the sum of modal responses at each order of 
 perturbation: 0, 1 and 2. Each model response is determined using
 propagator matrix method, which is based on Runge-Kutta numerical scheme.
